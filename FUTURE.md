## homework.py
1. Instead of typing the full seed, have an auto correct in the form of a placeholder as you type for you to tab. you can continue pressing tab to "scroll" through options
2. Add a Goto feature where you can go to a question in the form of a number(eg: 177, 21, 1, 9, etc). It will use the current seed or structured mode
3. don't create a new seed everytime i toggle between showing all and showing completed
4. add logging so you can mark questions as correct or not and have the duration spent on it logged.
5. Add feature where you can view the entire page which the answer or question came from and scroll through the pdf in that popup where that specific question or answer has the red rectangle around it. Make sure the pdf popup is also zoomable
6. Make it copy the PDFs to the current directory and rename them Answer and Question along with that Pair ID. Ex: Question-asdf879.pdf Answer-asdf879.pdf
7. Make the JSON files not be OS specific so i can just share them
8. allow combining of different sessions. It will request how many sessions and you can put the number then it will ask for Session 1's important files then Session's 2s, etc
9. Make it look like libwaita with rounded corners and a specific design. Nice and GNOME with my hyprland border colors
10. make it hard to double click the buttons by having a slight delay where if more then one click is made in 200ms, only the first is registered
11. add VIM Navigations shortcuts such as the following
   - h and l for going back and forwards questions
   - gg for going to the beginning one
12. make it so i can edit a marked help without removing it
