## link.py
1. the colors when you switch from Link Mode and normal don't stay the same. They all turn red and no visuals exist
2. Add Feature where you can fullscreen a pdf to do the box creating. you could do the zooming to get it right as well
3. remove the link session and add it's functionality to the normal one
4. make it so when you press the question OR the answer the other pdf scrolls automatically. This feature will no longer be exclusive to clicking answers
5. make it so when you use the arrows to navigate questions, since they select the questions, it will show the answer automatically. This can probably be turned off in a config file or in a simple code checkbox if it was annoying but it could be genuinely useful. 

## homework.py
1. Instead of typing the full seed, have an auto correct in the form of a placeholder as you type for you to tab. you can continue pressing tab to "scroll" through options
2. Add a Goto feature where you can go to a question in the form of a number(eg: 177, 21, 1, 9, etc). It will use the current seed or structured mode
3. don't create a new seed everytime i toggle between showing all and showing completed
4. add logging so you can mark questions as correct or not and have the duration spent on it logged.
5. Add feature where you can view the entire page which the answer or question came from and scroll through the pdf in that popup where that specific question or answer has the red rectangle around it. Make sure the pdf popup is also zoomable
6. Make it copy the PDFs to the current directory and rename them Answer and Question along with that Pair ID. Ex: Question-asdf879.pdf Answer-asdf879.pdf
7. Make the JSON files not be OS specific so i can just share them
8. allow combining of different sessions. It will request how many sessions and you can put the number then it will ask for Session 1's important files then Session's 2s, etc
9. Make it look like libwaita with rounded corners and a specific design. Nice and GNOME with my hyprland border colors
10. make it hard to double click the buttons by having a slight delay where if more then one click is made in 200ms, only the first is registered
11. add VIM Navigations shortcuts such as the following
   - h and l for going back and forwards questions
   - gg for going to the beginning one
   - f for searching for a selection id
   - F1 for seeing all keybinds(similar to Yazi)
12. make it so i can edit a marked help without removing it
13. make it so pressing enter after marking something as help actually works instead of requiring a mouse
14. create a keyboard shortcut for all buttons and if you hold ctrl for Φ seconds, the shortcuts will show, similar to how it does in chatGPT but instead of showing abruptly, it will have a smooth transition to show the shortcuts
15. have a way to delete a question (and therefore, its answer link) in case there is a mismatch and there is a question which doesn't have a correct answer for the question because that answer is for a seperate questions which isn't on the PDF. This is just one edge case that none of the other marks are appropiate
16. make it always use the same seed from last time and make sure that all the buttons don't switch the seed unless you click that button
17. make the buttons readable
18. make a filter to only show Need Help Marked questions
19. Make a button which has all the following filters which pops up a window with easy checkmarks which can be checked or unchecked using your number keys
  - Only Questions With stem
  - Only Questions without stem
  - Only completed questions
  - Only Questions not completed
  - Only incorrect questions
  - Only questions not incorrect
  - Filter by Pages
20. Make a bunch of little buttons to mark the questions using the following characteristics
      - Complete
      - Incorrect
      - Need Help
21.
